Firebase.NET implements Firebase Cloud Messaging HTTP Protocol that enables sending notifications to Android, iOS and Web clients through Firebase Cloud Messaging. 

It is written entirely in C# and can be used in any c# or .net projects.


## Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) HTTP Protocol
The FCM service enables developers to push notifications to their client apps to Android, iOS and Web clients. To use it, create a project in the [FCM console](https://console.firebase.google.com)


## Firebase.NET Library

The library provides for models that can be pushed to client apps:
* AndroidNotification
* IosNotification
* WebNotification
* CrossPlatformNotification

### How to use Firebase.NET

Below is a sample on pushing notifications to your client apps through Firebase.NET

```csharp
using Firebase.NET.Messages;
using Firebase.NET.Notifications;
using Firebase.NET.Infrastructure;

RequestMessage requestMessage = new RequestMessage();
string[] ids = {
    //registration tokens here
};

requestMessage.Body.RegistrationIds = ids;
CrossPlatformNotification notification = new CrossPlatformNotification();
notification.Title = "Important News";
notification.Body = String.Format("This is a notification send from Firebase on {0} {1}", 
                                   DateTime.Now.ToShortDateString(),
                                   DateTime.Now.ToShortTimeString());
requestMessage.Body.Notification = notification;

Payload payload = new Payload();
payload["leage"] = "UEFA";
payload["game"] = "Albania vs Kosovo";
payload["score"] = "1:1";
requestMessage.Body.Data = payload;

Func<string, string, bool> updateFunc = new Func<string, string, bool>(Update);
Func<string, bool> deleteFunc = new Func<string, bool>(Delete);

PushNotificationService pushService = new PushNotificationService(updateFunc, deleteFunc);

var responseMessage = await pushService.PushMessage(requestMessage);

```
