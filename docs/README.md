## Welcome to Firebase.NET

![Firebase.NET Logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UrimKurtishi/Firebase.NET/master/FirebaseNET.jpg)

Firebase.NET implements Firebase Cloud Messaging HTTP Protocol that enables sending notifications to Android, iOS and Web clients through Firebase Cloud Messaging.

### How to use Firebase.NET

Below are few sample on pushing notifications to your client apps through Firebase.NET

```csharp
using Firebase.NET.Messages;
using Firebase.NET.Notifications;
using Firebase.NET.Infrastructure;

RequestMessage requestMessage = new RequestMessage();
string[] ids = {
                //registration tokens here
};

requestMessage.Body.RegistrationIds = ids;
CrossPlatformNotification notification = new CrossPlatformNotification();
notification.Title = "Important News";
notification.Body = String.Format("This is a notification send from Firebase on {0} {1}", DateTime.Now.ToShortDateString(),              DateTime.Now.ToShortTimeString());
requestMessage.Body.Notification = notification;

Payload payload = new Payload();
payload["leage"] = "UEFA";
payload["game"] = "Albania vs Kosovo";
payload["score"] = "1:1";
requestMessage.Body.Data = payload;

Func<string, string, bool> updateFunc = new Func<string, string, bool>(Update);
Func<string, bool> deleteFunc = new Func<string, bool>(Delete);

PushNotificationService pushService = new PushNotificationService(updateFunc, deleteFunc);

var responseMessage = await pushService.PushMessage(requestMessage);

```
