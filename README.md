## Welcome to Firebase.NET  [Official site](https://urimkurtishi.github.io/Firebase.NET/)

Firebase.NET implements Firebase Cloud Messaging HTTP Protocol that enables sending notifications to Android, iOS and Web clients through Firebase Cloud Messaging.

It is a small and lightweight .NET client library written entirely in C# with high performance and reliability. It provides handling mechanism and retry provider (implementing exponential backoff algorithm) for response messages returned from FCM servers. It has been tested and itâ€™s used by different companies and projects.

### How to use Firebase.NET

Below is a sample on pushing notifications to your client apps through Firebase.NET

```csharp
using Firebase.NET.Messages;
using Firebase.NET.Notifications;

string[] ids = {
    //registration tokens here
};

var requestMessage = new RequestMessage
{
    Body =
    {
        RegistrationIds = ids,
        Notification = new CrossPlatformNotification
        {
            Title = "Important Notification",
            Body = "This is a notification send from Firebase.NET"
        },
        Data = new Dictionary<string, string>
        {
            { "leage", "UEFA" },
            { "game", "Albania vs Kosovo!" },
	    { "score", "1:1" }
        }
    }
};
       
var pushService = new PushNotificationService("yourFcmServerKey");
var responseMessage = await pushService.PushMessage(requestMessage);

```
